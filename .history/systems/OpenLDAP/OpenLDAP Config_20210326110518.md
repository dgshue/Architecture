## OpenLDAP Notes

OpenLDAP is provided by the osixia/docker-phpLDAPadmin container.

https://github.com/osixia/docker-phpLDAPadmin#make-your-own-phpldapadmin-image

It's served from uncg-gcrnet01 and available on standard ports.  Persistent container data is stored in docker volumes; ldap db is mounted to a docker volume called 'ldap', and the ldap config for openLDAP is mounted to a volume called 'ldap-config'.  phpLDAPadmin also has a volume for SSL certs called 'certs', but all other configuration is non-persistent Both volumes are located in the default docker volume location /var/lib/docker/volumes.

There is a custom image for phpLDAPadmin that is located in this repo.  There was an issue with SSLStapling in apache2 from the osixia image.  OCSP verification is impossible with the current state of gcrNet so disabling SSLStapling within the image was necessary.  There was a modification of the image/service/phpldapadmin/startup.sh file to create a link to a modified version of ssl.conf which is located in image/service/phpldapadmin/assets/apache2.

    ```bash
      # Custom SSL config
      #

        log-helper info "Set apache2 ssl config..."
        ln -sf ${CONTAINER_SERVICE_DIR}/phpldapadmin/assets/apache2/ssl.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/ssl.conf
    ```
